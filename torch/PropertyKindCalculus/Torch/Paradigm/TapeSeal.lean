`paradigm.tape_seal` — **the seal of the computation**: the cone lemma for `evalTape`, and the
second capstone theorem on the tape a carrier-generic module records.

The cone lemma (`evalTape_cone`) says that re-evaluating a well-formed tape from an environment of
leaf values gives, at every node, a value that depends only on the named leaves in that node's
backward cone in the computational tape graph: two environments agreeing on those leaves give the
same value at the node. The tape-side counterpart of the pedigree reading
(`Provenance.mem_ancestorsOf_iff`).

The seal of the computation (`semantic_seal`) composes it with the kind-transporting weak
bisimulation (`Graph.Bisimulation`): for a well-formed provenance hypergraph `g` and an accepted
match `m` between `g` and the graph of a well-formed tape `t`, at every node `o` of `g` realized by
a tape vertex `r`,

  * two environments that agree on the leaves realizing the *influencers* of `o` — the sources the
    hypergraph names for it — give the same value at `r`;
  * every leaf in the cone of `r`, a named input or a baked constant, realizes an influencer of
    `o` — so every constant the computation uses at `o` is one the hypergraph lists in `o`'s
    assumption ledger;
  * every tape edge between two observable vertices realizes one hop of one occurrence of `g`, so
    the kinds transported along the relation change only where an occurrence states the change.

`semantic_seal_of_denotes` is the carrier-generic reading: any function of the environment that
denotes as the tape's value at `r` — which is what the denotation bridge (`paradigm.tape_parity`)
establishes per carrier — depends on its inputs only through the influencers of `o`. The
hypergraph's absence claims become semantic: an input the harvest says cannot reach `o` provably
does not, in the computation.

A `module` file: imports the tape evaluator and the graph library's bisimulation and seal.
