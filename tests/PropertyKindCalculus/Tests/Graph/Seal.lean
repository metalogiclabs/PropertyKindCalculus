# Validation probes — the seal of a module (capstone 1)

Inhabitation, negative and axiom-profile probes for `Graph.Seal`: a `Nat`-labelled instance
whose well-formedness and seal the kernel decides, the theorem applied to it, a mutant with
an anonymous mint that fails the hypothesis *and* the conclusion — so the hypothesis is seen
to carry the weight — and the axiom profiles of the three statements, pinned.
`seal_witnesses` conjoins the instance and the mutant for the blueprint's witness node.

/-- The theorem, applied: the seal follows from well-formedness on the instance. -/
example : GN.Sealed := sealed_of_wellFormed GN_wellFormed

/-- The seal of the output, applied: every ancestor of `out` is a source or derived from
ancestors of `out`. -/

lemma GNmut_not_sealed : ¬ GNmut.Sealed := by decide

-- The undeclared leaf is exactly the mint.

mutant fails both. The axiom profile of the seal itself is pinned below. -/
