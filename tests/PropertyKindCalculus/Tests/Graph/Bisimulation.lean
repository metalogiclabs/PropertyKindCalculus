# Validation probes — the kind-transporting weak bisimulation (capstone 2's relation)

An authored pair the kernel decides: a provenance hypergraph with a product and a same-kind
sum, `y = a · b + e`, and the computational tape graph its complex realization records — the
product expanded to `(ac − bd) + (ad + bc)j`, four interior vertices the bisimulation is silent
on, the sum componentwise. The match's acceptance is decided by the kernel, the three
bisimulation theorems are instantiated on it, and a mutant tape that bakes one constant the
hypergraph does not list is refused — the hypothesis fails where the conclusion's constant
clause would. `bisimulation_witnesses` conjoins the instance and the mutant for the
blueprint's witness node.
