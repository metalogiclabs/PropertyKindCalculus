# Validation probes — the seal of the computation on a recorded tape (capstone 2)

The bisimulation probes (`Tests.Graph.Bisimulation`) decide a match between an authored
hypergraph, `y = a · b + e`, and an authored tape graph. This module closes the loop with the
recorder: the same expression, instantiated at the complex carrier over the recording carrier,
is recorded, compacted, and projected onto its computational tape graph — which is, vertex
for vertex, the graph the bisimulation probes accept once its vertices are numbered in the
recorder's order. The match on the recorded graph is decided by the kernel, the cone lemma
and the seal of the computation are instantiated on it, and the recorded values are checked
against the seal's value clause at runtime: two environments that agree on the influencers
give the same value at both parts of `y`.

The projection `ofTape t == T` is a runtime check (the tape's stored tensors are opaque to
the kernel); the match's acceptance on `T`, and every theorem applied to it, is a kernel
theorem.
