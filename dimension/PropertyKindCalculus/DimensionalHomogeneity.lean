# DimensionalHomogeneity — the third capstone, on PhysLib's dimensions

`Provenance.homogeneity` (core, `Derivation`) is stated over any rule algebra. This module
supplies the one the coverage command evaluates (`DimensionalCoverage`): on PhysLib's
`Dimension B`, a product adds the operand exponents, a quotient subtracts them, a
reciprocal negates them, a power scales them by its rational exponent, a transcendental
demands dimension one, a reference and a copy preserve, a same-kind sum demands equal
operands, and a nominal selection demands equal branches. A `step` has no rule — a
procedure edge's dimensional content is its member's own graph.

With that algebra, `dimensional_homogeneity` is the third capstone: for a well-formed
provenance hypergraph whose declared dimensions are homomorphic along every occurrence —
the verdict the coverage command reports as `[coherent]`, per occurrence — the dimension
of every derived node and every output is the one the rules compute from the sources'
dimensions, and any assignment that follows the rules from the same sources agrees with
the declared one everywhere. `dim_homomorphism` (`Interaction`) is the per-edge, per-algebra
form of the same fact for a curated product; `product_rule` below is where the two meet.

Mathlib-backed through PhysLib, so it lives in the `Dimension` library; build with
`lake build Dimension`.

/-- **Dimensional homogeneity along the hypergraph** (the third capstone). Let `g` be a
well-formed provenance hypergraph and `dimOf` the declared dimension of each kind. If the
declared assignment is homomorphic along every occurrence under the coverage rules — the
`[coherent]` verdict per occurrence — then every assignment that follows the rules from the
same source dimensions agrees with the declared one on every known node, hence on every
output and every derived node: the dimension functor is a homomorphism along every path of
`g`, and every output's dimension is computed from the sources' alone. -/
